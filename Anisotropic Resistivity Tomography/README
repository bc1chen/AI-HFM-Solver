This is a testing code for solving three-dimensional steady anisotropic problem with multigrid. 
------------ Testing and debugging -----------------
Anisotropic_3d_Multigrid_7point.ipynb: 
Initial testing code for a cube domain with uniform grid size and without boundary conditions
Anisotropic_3d_Multigrid_7point_BC.ipynb: 
Add Neumann boundary condition at the top of the domain 
**Anisotropic_3d_Multigrid_7point_BC_Rec.ipynb**: 
Test the code for a rectangular domain still with uniform grid size
